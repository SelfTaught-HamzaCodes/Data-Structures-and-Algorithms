## Linear Data Structures
Linear data structures organize and store elements sequentially, such as Linked Lists, Queues, and Stacks.
***
### Linked Lists:
- **Singly Linked List** in `Linked_List_Singly.py`.
- **Doubly Linked List** in `Linked_List_Doubly.py`.

  ***
  - ⚠ I have introduced a 'Tail' attribute to enhance the time complexity when traversing to the last element. However, it's worth noting that the 'Tail' attribute consumes slightly more memory.
  - ⚠ Additionally, I've incorporated methods that are available by default for lists into the implementation."
  ***

### Queue and Stacks:
- **Queue** in `Queue_Default.py`.
- **Priority Queue** in `Queue_Priority.py`.
- **Double-ended Queue** in `Queue_Deck.py`.
- **Stacks** in `Stacks.py`.
