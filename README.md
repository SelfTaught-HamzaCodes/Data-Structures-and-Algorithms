# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
A repository that holds implementation for most of the *commonly* used **Data Structures**, these are implemented in **Python**.

### What are Data-Structures and Algorithms ?
**Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** encompass the tools (data structures) and procedures (algorithms) used in computer science to organize and manipulate data efficiently for problem-solving

### Common Data Structures and Algorithms:
1. [**Linear Data Structures**](https://github.com/SelfTaught-HamzaCodes/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/main/Linear-Data-Structures).

   Linear data structures organize and store elements sequentially, such as Linked Lists, Queues, and Stacks.
    - Linked List.
    - Queue.
    - Stack.
2. [**Hash Tables**](https://github.com/SelfTaught-HamzaCodes/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/main/Hash-Tables).

   Hash tables are data structures that use a hash function to store and retrieve values based on keys efficiently.
   - Hash Maps / Hash Tables.
3. [**Search and Sorting Algorithms**](https://github.com/SelfTaught-HamzaCodes/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/main/Searching-and-Sorting-Algorithms).
   
     Search algorithms locate specific elements within data, while sorting algorithms rearrange data elements in a particular order for efficient retrieval.
   - Binary Search Algorithm.
   - Bubble Sort.
   - Counting Sort.
   - Insertion Sort.
   - Merge Sort.
   - Quick Sort.
   - Radix Sort.
   - Tim Sort.
     
4. [**Tree-Based Data Structures**](https://github.com/SelfTaught-HamzaCodes/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/main/Tree-based-Data-Structures).
   
     Tree-based data structures, like Heaps and Binary Trees, are hierarchical structures used for tasks such as prioritization and efficient searching.
   - Binary Search Tree.
   - Heap.
